# NullSpend-Express.js0REST.APIs-Webpack-
Used the vanilla client-side technologies (HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript) and Webpack for a bundler. For the back-end development, I have used Express.js for the REST-API. I have utilized the third-party API provided by Unsplash, which allows the application to fetch image-related data under the hood.
